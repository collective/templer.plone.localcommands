Introduction
============

This package is part of the templer code generator system.  It provides local
command templates for the ``archetype`` and ``plone_basic`` templates from
templer.plone_ and is dependent on that package.  Installing 
``templer.plone[localcommands]`` will automatically include this package.

Local Commands
==============

Templer local commands are an extension of the PasteScript_ local command 
concept which allow the user to insert additional features into a skeleton 
package already created by a templer template.

Executing Local Commands
------------------------

The first step in accessing local commands is to build a package skeleton 
using one of the templer templates which support local commands::

    bin/templer plone_basic example.package

When the run is completed, you should see output that informs you that 
localcommands are available for this new package::

    Your new package supports local commands. To access them, change
    directories into the 'src' directory inside your new package. From there,
    you will be able to run the command `paster add --list` to see the local
    commands available for this package.

.. note ::

    Local commands do not work on setup.py folder level. You need to enter
    the src/ folder itself.

Follow these instructions to see the local commands you have available to you
from the context of your ``plone_basic`` package skeleton.  You may also run
``paster add --list-all`` to see the full list of local commands available in
your current installation.  Commands not available within the current package
will be prefaced with an 'N' character in the listing.
